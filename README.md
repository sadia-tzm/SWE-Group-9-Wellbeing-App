# FDM Wellbeing Application
Mindfulness Application for FDM Employees

Pre-requisites to run:
Need firebase database set up with authenticator for web, then put:

SFE_Group_9\wellbeing_app\src     <-    fire.js
SFE_Group_9\wellbeing_app         <-    ServiceAccountKey.json

Where fire.js holds firebaseConfig from firebase->settings->general->scroll down (and copy into local file. make sure to set up imports, as it's just a variable)
And ServiceAccountKey.json is firebase->settings->Service accounts->java->generate new private key

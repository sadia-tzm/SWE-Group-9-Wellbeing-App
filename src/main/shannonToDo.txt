This regards FDMEmployee -> attemptMindfulnessExercise
                         -> attemptWorkoutExercise


attemptMindfulnessExercise:

    for attemptNumber, get attemptNumber of the last item in mindfulnessExerciseAttempts, then + 1

    then check if the mindfulnessExercise from the GUI is of subtype "BreathingExercise".
    -> if yes then create a new BreathingExerciseAttempt object (but still of type MindfulnessExerciseAttempt)
    -> if no then just create regular MindfulnessExerciseAttempt


got bored of writing but the same thing with WorkoutExerciseAttempt and StepExerciseAttempt
